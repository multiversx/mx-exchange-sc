# Farm Staking Proxy Contract

## Abstract

Metastaking is a new way to empower users that provide liquidity, by giving them the ability to stake their tokens in order to receive rewards as stakers. But how can users stake assets that they currently do not hold? Well, through trustworthy simulated transfers. By using a proxy contract, that is whitelisted in the staking contract, we can send the data feed to the staking contract, like the simulated transfers. By doing so, the proxy contract keeps the actual farm token amounts, and the staking process is organized through a dual yield token, that is minted and burned by this SC. 

## Introduction

This SC works in conjunction with the Farm Staking contract and offers the configuration means for the dual yield token, that takes care of the staking logic of the farm staking process. As a high level overview, we can underline the following steps:
- The user follows the usual steps to enter a simple farm: add liquidity + enter farm with the LP tokens
- He then sends the farming tokens to the farm staking proxy contract
- The proxy contract calculates the user's position and simulates a transfer on his behalf to the staking contract. By being whitelisted as a trustworthy address, the staking contract accepts the data as a simulated transfer
- The staking contract calculates the farming token (by quoting the LP contract) and sends the farm staking position to the proxy contract
- The proxy contract keeps the farming token and sends the dual yield token instead to the user
- The user can then use the dual yield token to claim his rewards or unstake his position

To sum it up, we can say that the two contract farm staking mechanism allows the user to do all the usual operations for the normal farming contract, not directly, but through a proxy contract. And he can do all this by using the dual yield token.

## Setup Endpoints

### init

```rust
    #[init]
    fn init(
        &self,
        lp_farm_address: ManagedAddress,
        staking_farm_address: ManagedAddress,
        pair_address: ManagedAddress,
        staking_token_id: TokenIdentifier,
        lp_farm_token_id: TokenIdentifier,
        staking_farm_token_id: TokenIdentifier,
        lp_token_id: TokenIdentifier,
    );
```
The deployment function, it receives the required variables like token ids and addresses, in order to properly setup the proxy contract.

### registerDualYieldToken

```rust
    #[payable("EGLD")]
    #[endpoint(registerDualYieldToken)]
    fn register_dual_yield_token(
        &self,
        token_display_name: ManagedBuffer,
        token_ticker: ManagedBuffer,
        num_decimals: usize,
    );
```

Endpoint that allows the setup of the dual yield token. It receives the standard parameters for creating a new token, as is payable in eGLD.

### setLocalRolesDualYieldToken

```rust
    #[endpoint(setLocalRolesDualYieldToken)]
    fn set_local_roles_dual_yield_token(&self);
```

Endpoint that allows the setup of the dual yield token roles. It adds the following roles: NftCreate, NftAddQuantity, NftBurn.

## Public Endpoints

### stakeFarmTokens

```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint(stakeFarmTokens)]
    fn stake_farm_tokens(&self);
```

The first endpoint in the farm staking workflow. It receives the farming token as a single or as a multiple payment. The endpoint calculates the position for each payment and burns the current dual yield token for the corresponding nonce, if there is any. The workflow continues by quoting the LP contract of the correct token amount and then simulates a token transfer with that amount towards the farm staking contract. It will then receive the corresponding farm staking token amount (amount that will remain inside the contract) and will send the user the corresponding dual yield token.
It is important to mention that only the proxy contract can simulate the token transfer, by being whitelisted inside the farm staking contract to do so. That means that any outside attempts to replicate this process will fail in the staking contract.
Another aspect that is worth mentioning is that the endpoint will try to merge the user's position. For that, it calls the merging function of the farm staking contract in order to give the user a combined position.

### claimDualYield

```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint(claimDualYield)]
    fn claim_dual_yield(&self);
```

For claiming rewards from the farm staking contract, the user has to send his dual yield tokens to the proxy contract as a payment. Based on this payment, the proxy contract identifies the corresponding position for the user and burns those dual yield tokens. It then uses the staking farm tokens to claim the corresponding rewards. In the end, the proxy contract sends those claimed rewards to the user, along with a new, reset position for the dual yield tokens.
One thing to note here is that between claiming rewards in the farming contract and the staking contract, the balance of the LP token may vary. Because of that, the proxy contract first harvest the rewards from the farming contract with the initial known value and then requotes the LP contract to get the new LP ratio (that may or may not vary). It then harvest rewards with the new value.

### unstakeFarmTokens

```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint(unstakeFarmTokens)]
    fn unstake_farm_tokens(
        &self,
        pair_first_token_min_amount: BigUint,
        pair_second_token_min_amount: BigUint,
    );
```

To unstake his current position, a user must send the desired amount of dual yield tokens to the proxy contract. At this moment, the proxy contract knows, based on the sent dual yield token, both the farm token position and staking token position. The first step is for the proxy contract to withdraw the LP tokens from the farms and the liquidity from the pair contract. After that all the harvested rewards, the resulting eGLD from removing the LP token and the unstake position of the staking token are all sent to the user. The unstaking process is ended with the burning of the dual yield tokens.
It is important to note that because of the userâ€™s unstaked position, an unbonding period is not needed.

# Farm Staking Proxy OnBehalf Operations

## Abstract

The Farm Staking Proxy contract enables complex yield strategies by managing dual yield positions. The OnBehalf operations allow whitelisted contracts to manage these positions for users, combining LP farming and staking rewards while maintaining proper ownership and security through the Permissions Hub.

## Introduction

This feature extends the dual yield functionality with delegated operations, allowing third-party contracts to manage composite farming positions. It maintains the security of underlying positions, proper reward distribution, and ownership tracking while enabling more complex DeFi integrations through the Permissions Hub.

## Endpoints

### stakeFarmOnBehalf

```rust
#[payable("*")]
#[endpoint(stakeFarmOnBehalf)]
fn stake_farm_on_behalf(&self, original_owner: ManagedAddress) -> StakeProxyResult<Self::Api>
```

The stakeFarmOnBehalf function enables whitelisted contracts to create dual yield positions. It receives:

- __original_owner__ - The address of the user for whom the position is being created
- __payments__ - Multiple token payments required for the dual yield position:
  - First payment must be an LP farm token
  - Additional payments must belong to the same original owner

The function performs these operations:
1. Validates caller's whitelist status through Permissions Hub
2. Verifies ownership of all provided tokens
3. Creates the dual yield position
4. Distributes the results:
   - LP farm boosted rewards to original owner
   - Staking boosted rewards to original owner
   - Dual yield tokens to caller

### claimDualYieldOnBehalf

```rust
#[payable("*")]
#[endpoint(claimDualYieldOnBehalf)]
fn claim_dual_yield_on_behalf(&self) -> ClaimDualYieldResult<Self::Api>
```

The claimDualYieldOnBehalf function allows whitelisted contracts to claim rewards from dual yield positions. It requires:

- __payment__ - A dual yield token payment

The function performs these steps:
1. Extracts original owner from underlying farm position
2. Validates caller's whitelist status for the token owner
3. Claims both LP farming and staking rewards
4. Distributes rewards:
   - LP farm rewards to original owner
   - Staking farm rewards to original owner
   - New dual yield tokens to caller

## exitOnBehalf
The exit operation remains under the direct control of the position owner to ensure maximum security. When third-party contracts interact with farming or staking positions through onBehalf operations, they receive and hold the position tokens. These tokens maintain the original owner information in their attributes, protecting the user's ownership rights. To exit their position, users must first reclaim their position tokens from the third-party contract through that protocol's specific mechanisms. Once users have regained control of their position tokens, they can perform the standard exit operation directly through the specific xExchange contract. 
This design ensures users maintain ultimate control over their funds while allowing protocols to build complex DeFi interactions.

## Storage

The contract maintains its standard dual yield token storage and relies on underlying contracts and the Permissions Hub for any additional data.

## Deployment

The onBehalf features require:

1. Proper configuration of:
   - Permissions Hub address
   - LP Farm contract address
   - Staking Farm contract address
   - Token IDs and roles

2. Required external contracts:
   - Active Permissions Hub
   - Active LP Farm contract
   - Active Staking Farm contract
